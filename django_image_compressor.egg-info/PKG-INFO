Description: # Django Image Compressor
        
        Django Image Compressor is a tool to compress your images. Easy to plug-in and easy to use.
        
        ### Installation
        
        To install django-image-compressor
        ```sh
        $ pip install django-image-compressor
        ```
        
        Add the app to your project:
        ```py
        # settings.py
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'django-image-compressor',
            ...
        )
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        Package will add additional 4 fields to your forms. You can compress your images by reducing the quality of the images or resize them or both. If you leave input width and/or height fields empty and try to resize your image, sizes will be reduced twice. Only compressed images will be saved to your db and original ones will be ignored.
        
        In order to use the compressor, first create a ModelForm in forms.py and add ImageCompressorFormMixin to your form:
        
        ```py
        # forms.py
        from django import forms
        from django-image-compressor.mixins import ImageCompressorFormMixin
        
        class YourImageUploadForm(ImageCompressorFormMixin, forms.ModelForm):
            ...
            compressed_image_fields = ('your_image_field_1', 'your_image_field2', ...)
            ...
        
        ```
        
        Then add ImageCompressorViewMixin to your Create and/or Update View.
        
        ```py
        # views.py
        from django.views.generic import CreateView
        
        class YourImageUploadView(ImageCompressorViewMixin, CreateView):
            ...
            compressed_image_fields = ('your_image_field_1', 'your_image_field2', ...)
            form_class = YourImageUploadForm
            ...
        
        ```
        
        If you want to add compressor to your Django Admin Site, then add ImageCompressorAdminMixin and the created form to your ModelAdmin class.
        
        ```py
        # admin.py
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django-image-compressor.mixins import ImageCompressorAdminMixin
        
        class YourModelAdmin(ImageCompressorAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
            ...
            custom_form = SliderCreateForm
            ...
        
        ```
